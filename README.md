# Phantom

Phantom is a Rust code-graph engine.

Pre-release. Version 0.0.0. Nothing here is published from this tree.

The crates build on unix only. There is no Windows build.

## What works today

The `phantom-fractal` package builds two binaries from one `main.rs`: `phantom-fractal` and `fract`. Scripts should call `phantom-fractal`, since another program named `fract` may come first on `PATH`.

They have four commands:

- `index PATH` walks the Rust files under PATH, extracts their items, `use` paths, and calls, and stores them in a SQLite database in the Phantom data directory. It then builds each package's module tree and resolves calls to edges, as [Calls](#calls) describes. PATH itself is only read. A second run over an unchanged tree writes nothing.
- `find NAME` returns the indexed symbols named exactly NAME as `hits`, each with its kind, visibility, path, and line, ordered by path and then line. It returns at most 100; `truncated` is true when more matched. A name that was not indexed returns no hits.
- `callers SYMBOL` returns the resolved calls to SYMBOL.
- `callees SYMBOL` returns the resolved calls SYMBOL makes, and `unresolved_calls`: how many calls, method calls, and macros inside SYMBOL have no edge.

Run `find`, `callers`, and `callees` from the directory you indexed, or pass `--repo PATH`.

Each command prints one JSON envelope: `{"ok": …, "data": …, "error": …, "schema": 1}`. An error exits with its canon code, for example 2 when the tree has no index yet and 3 when PATH does not exist.

```
fract index .
fract find open_ledger
fract callers util::helper
fract callees crate::entry
```

The `index` envelope holds counts only, never a path:

- files: `written`, `unchanged`, `not_utf8`, and `skipped`;
- the graph: `modules`, `orphans` (`.rs` files no target reaches), and `edges`;
- calls left without an edge: `unresolved`, `external`, `no_source`, `method_calls`, and `macros`.

A pass that rebuilds nothing reads the graph counts back from the stored graph.

The database lives at `repos/<name>-<hash>/graph.db` under the data directory. That directory is `~/Library/Application Support/phantom-fractal` on macOS, and `$XDG_DATA_HOME/phantom-fractal` (default `~/.local/share/phantom-fractal`) elsewhere. Set `PHANTOM_FRACTAL_DATA` to use another directory. `index` refuses a data directory inside PATH.

The directories Phantom creates on the way to `graph.db` are private, mode `0700`: the data directory when it is new, `repos/`, and `repos/<name>-<hash>/`. An existing `repos/` or `repos/<name>-<hash>/` that group or others can open is set back to `0700`. A data directory that already existed, such as one named by `PHANTOM_FRACTAL_DATA`, is left as it is. `graph.db`, `graph.db-wal`, and `graph.db-shm` are mode `0600`.

### What `index` skips

`index` reads regular files only. It skips:

- symlinks. A link is never followed; a target inside PATH is indexed under its own path.
- hard links: any file whose link count is over 1.
- anything else that is not a regular file, such as a fifo, socket, or device.
- files over 1 MiB. No part of such a file is stored.
- secret names: `.env*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `id_<name>` and `id_<name>.pub`, `credentials`, `.netrc`, `.npmrc`, `*.p12`, and `*.pfx`, ignoring ASCII case. Only the file name is matched, so `credentials.rs` and `id_codec.rs` are still indexed.

## Calls

SYMBOL is a bare name such as `helper`, or a module-qualified name such as `util::helper`, `crate::util::helper`, or `Counter::new`. A symbol's qualified name starts at `crate`, its target's root, and its last segments must equal SYMBOL's segments. A symbol in an orphan file has no module, so its qualified name starts at its own name or `impl` type.

- No symbol matches: `not_found`, exit 3.
- More than one matches: `ambiguous`, exit 6. The message lists up to 10 candidates with their paths and lines, `data.candidates` holds the same ones, and `data.total` counts them all. Qualify the name further to pick one.
- The tree has no index, or its index predates call edges: `no_index`, exit 2. Run `index` again.

On success, `data.symbol` is the symbol's qualified name, kind, path, and line. Each entry in `data.hits` is one edge:

- `name`, `kind`, and `symbol_path`: the other symbol's qualified name, its kind, and the file it is declared in.
- `path` and `line`: the call site.
- `confidence` and `reason`: how the call was placed.

Hits are sorted by path and then line. There are at most 100, and `truncated` is true when more existed. Every path is relative to the indexed tree.

```
$ fract callers util::helper
{"ok":true,"data":{"symbol":{"name":"crate::util::helper","kind":"function","path":"src/util.rs","line":5},"hits":[{"name":"crate::entry","kind":"function","path":"src/lib.rs","line":17,"symbol_path":"src/lib.rs","confidence":1.0,"reason":"path-exact"}],"truncated":false},"error":null,"schema":1}
```

That output is cut to one hit.

### How a call is placed

Only a path call inside a function is a candidate: `f()`, `a::f()`, or `Type::new()`. A single-segment name that the function binds with `let`, a parameter, a closure parameter, or a pattern is shadowed and not resolved. A call gets an edge only when exactly one symbol fits. Otherwise it gets no edge and is counted instead.

| Reason | Confidence | When |
|---|---|---|
| `path-exact` | 1.0 | The path starts with `crate`, `self`, or `super` and walks to one item or method in the same target. |
| `local` | 0.95 | The first segment is an item or child module declared in the call's module, and the rest walks to one item or method. |
| `use-alias` | 0.95 | The first segment is bound by a `use` that is not a glob, or by its `as` alias, in the call's module. The `use` path resolves by the rows above, and the rest walks to one item or method. |
| `assoc` | 0.9 | `Type::name`, where `Type` resolves by the rows above to one struct, enum, or trait, and exactly one inherent method of that type is named `name`. |

### Never resolved

- Method calls on values, such as `x.m()` and `self.m()`, and `Self::m()`.
- Trait dispatch, including `<T as Trait>::f` and a method only a trait impl defines.
- Names that only a glob import such as `use a::*` supplies.
- Macros. They are counted by name, and calls inside a macro's arguments are not seen.
- Other crates, including `std`, `core`, and `alloc`, and a bin calling its own package's lib by crate name.
- `[lib] path` and `[[bin]] path` in `Cargo.toml`. The targets are `src/lib.rs`, `src/main.rs`, and `src/bin/*.rs`.

### Nothing runs

Phantom reads source text only. Macros are never expanded. Phantom never runs cargo, rustc, rust-analyzer, a build script, a proc macro, or any other code or command from the indexed repo.

## Other

`--version` prints `phantom-fractal 0.0.0`. `--help` lists the four commands with a usage line, and so does a run with no command. `find` matches names only. There is no other command.
